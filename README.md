# Multicloud Platform

## Overview ##
Multicloud Platform is a specially-arranged razor-thin overlay layer that supports the open-source leveraged service composition in a cloud-agnostic way. It includes several elements to support the MSA-based service composition. It consists of Interface Proxy, Dev+Ops Post, Cloud-native Clusters, Connected DataLake and Visible Fabric. It provides the open-source leveraged service composition when given a containerized microservices pattern that corresponds to the targeted service.
